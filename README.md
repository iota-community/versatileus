# Versatileus

## Functionalities

- Keep threads alive once a week
- Support DCouter.space bot and ban main accounts of banned alt-accounts
- Kick @unverified group members every 8 hours

## Disclaimer

Slash commands can take some time to get registered globally, so if you want to test a command you should use
the `@app_commands.guilds()` decorator so that it gets registered instantly. Example:

```py
@commands.hybrid_command(
  name="command",
  description="Command description",
)
@app_commands.guilds(discord.Object(id=GUILD_ID)) # Place your guild ID here
```

When using the template you confirm that you have read the [license](LICENSE.md) and comprehend that I can take down
your repository if you do not meet these requirements.

Please do not open issues or pull requests about things that are written in the [TODO file](TODO.md), they are **already** under work for a future version of the template.
